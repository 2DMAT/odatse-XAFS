Optimization by Grid search
================================================================

In this section, we will explain how to perform a grid-type search to analyze atomic coordinates from spectrum data.
The grid type search is compatible with MPI.
The search grid is generated from the input parameters as an evenly spaced mesh.


Location of the sample files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sample files are located in ``sample/mapper``.
The following files are stored in the folder:

- ``mock_data.txt``, ``template.txt``

  Reference file to proceed with calculations in the main program.

- ``ref_ColorMap.txt``

  A file to check if the calculation was performed correctly (the answer to ``ColorMap.txt`` obtained by doing this tutorial).

- ``input.toml``

  Input file of the main program.

- ``prepare.sh``, ``do.sh``

  Script prepared for bulk calculation of this tutorial.

Below, we will describe these files and then show the actual calculation results.


Reference files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``template.txt`` is a template of the input file for FEFF.
In this tutorial, to reduce the computational cost, we will perform the two-parameter search for the coordinates x, y of a sulfur atom, with z fixed to z = -1.60.
The content of the file is shown below in which ``@x`` and ``@y`` correspond to the parameters to be varied.

The reference data that imitates experiments is stored in the file ``mock_data.txt`` that contains the spectrum data for three different directions of polarization.

Input file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the input file for the main program, ``input.toml``.
The details of ``input.toml`` can be found in the input file section of the manual.
The following is the content of ``input.toml`` in the sample file.

.. code-block::

    [base]
    dimension = 2
    output_dir = "output"

    [solver]
    name = "feff"

    [solver.config]
    feff_exec_file  = "../bin/feff85L"
    feff_output_file = "./chi.dat"
    remove_work_dir = true
    #use_tmpdir = true

    [solver.param]
    string_list = ["@x", "@y"]
    polarization_list = ["@Ex", "@Ey", "@Ez"]
    polarization = [ [0,1,0], [1,0,0], [0,0,1] ]
    calculated_first_k = 3.6
    calculated_last_k = 10

    [solver.reference]
    path_epsilon = "mock_data.txt"

    [algorithm]
    name = "mapper"
    label_list = ["x_S", "y_S"]

    [algorithm.param]
    min_list = [-2.0, -2.0]
    max_list = [ 2.0,  2.0]
    num_list = [41, 41]


First, ``[base]`` section is explained.

- ``dimension`` is the number of variables to be optimized. In this case, it is ``2`` since we are optimizing two variables as described in ``template.txt``.

- ``output_dir`` is the name of directory for the outputs. If it is omitted, the results are written in the directory in which the program is executed.

``[solver]`` section specifies the solver to be used inside the main program and its settings.

- ``name`` is the name of the solver you want to use. In this tutorial it is ``feff``.

The solver can be configured in the subsections ``[solver.config]``, ``[solver.param]``, and ``[solver.reference]``.

``[solver.config]`` section specifies options for ``feff85L`` called from the main program.

- ``feff_exec_file`` specifies the path to the FEFF executable.

- ``feff_output_file`` specifies the file among the output files of FEFF that contains the XAFS spectrum data.

- ``remove_work_dir`` specifies whether the work directory for the output of FEFF should be removed every after the calculation.

- ``use_tmpdir`` specifies whether the output files of FEFF should be written in /tmp.

``[solver.param]`` section specifies options for the input file of FEFF.

- ``string_list`` is a list of variable names embedded in ``template.txt``.

- ``polarization_list`` is a list of placeholders for the polarization vector embedded in ``template.txt``.

- ``polarization`` is a list of polarization vectors.

- ``calculated_first_k``, ``calculated_last_k`` are the lower and upper ends of the wave number for which the calculated values and the experimental data are to be compared.

``[solver.reference]`` section specifies the location of the experimental data and the range to read.

- ``path_epsilon`` specifies the path where the experimental data is located.

``[algorithm]`` section specifies the algorithm to use and its settings.

- ``name`` is the name of the algorithm you want to use. In this tutorial we will use ``mapper`` since we will be using grid-search method.

- ``label_list`` is a list of label names to be attached to the output of ``@x`` and ``@y``.

``[algorithm.param]`` section specifies the options to the search algorithm.

- ``min_list``, ``max_list``, ``num_list`` are the range of search grid and the number of grid points.

For details on other parameters that can be specified in the input file, please see the Input File section of the manual.


Calculation execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, move to the folder where the sample files are located. (We assume that you are directly under the directory where you downloaded this software.)

.. code-block::

     $ cd sample/mapper

Copy ``feff85L``.

.. code-block::

     $ cp ../../feff8.5light/build/feff85L .

Run the main program. The computation time will take only a few minutes on a normal PC.

.. code-block::

     $ mpiexec -np 4 odatse-STR input.toml | tee log.txt

Here, the calculation using MPI parallel with 4 processes will be done.
When executed, a folder for each rank will be created, and a subfolder ``LogXXXX_YYYY`` (where ``XXXX`` and ``YYYY`` are the grid id and the sequence number, respectively) will be created under it.
The standard output will look like as follows.

.. code-block::

    name            : mapper
    label_list      : ['x_S', 'y_S']
    param.min_list  : [-2, -2]

    param.num_list  : [41, 41]

    remove directory: Log00000001_00000000
    Iteration : 3/1681
    @x = -1.80000000
    @y = -2.00000000
    R-factor = 4.705703125161947 Polarization [0.0, 1.0, 0.0] R-factor1 = 2.2501916741803463  Polarization [1.0, 0.0, 0.0] R-factor2 = 2.7571748926393247  Polarization [0.0, 0.0, 1.0] R-factor3 = 9.10974280866617

    R-factor = 4.39649319022788 Polarization [0.0, 1.0, 0.0] R-factor1 = 2.1206013940826995  Polarization [1.0, 0.0, 0.0] R-factor2 = 2.2147936131325205  Polarization [0.0, 0.0, 1.0] R-factor3 = 8.85408456346842

    remove directory: Log00000004_00000000
    Iteration : 6/1681
    @x = -1.50000000
    @y = -2.00000000
    R-factor = 3.541334572415026 Polarization [0.0, 1.0, 0.0] R-factor1 = 1.918749679792313  Polarization [1.0, 0.0, 0.0] R-factor2 = 1.4179530692349396  Polarization [0.0, 0.0, 1.0] R-factor3 = 7.287300968217825 
    remove directory: Log00000005_00000000
    ...

``@x`` and ``@y`` are the candidate parameters for each mesh and ``R-factor`` is the function value at that point.
Finally, the ``R-factor`` calculated at all the points on the grid will be written to ``ColorMap.txt``.
In this case, the following results will be obtained.

.. code-block::

    -2.000000 -2.000000 4.844741
    -1.900000 -2.000000 4.868152
    -1.800000 -2.000000 4.705703
    -1.700000 -2.000000 4.396493
    -1.600000 -2.000000 3.960456
    ...

The first and second columns contain the values of ``@x`` and ``@y``, respectively, and the third column contains the ``R-factor``.

Note that ``do.sh`` is available as a script for batch calculation.
In ``do.sh``, ``res.txt`` and ``ref.txt`` are also compared for the check.
Here is what it does, without further explanation.

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/sh

    sh prepare.sh

    time mpiexec -np 4 odatse-XAFS input.toml

    echo diff output/ColorMap.txt ref_ColorMap.txt
    res=0
    diff output/ColorMap.txt ref_ColorMap.txt || res=$?
    if [ $res -eq 0 ]; then
      echo TEST PASS
      true
    else
      echo TEST FAILED: ColorMap.txt and ref_ColorMap.txt differ
      false
    fi


Visualization of calculation results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By examining ``ColorMap.txt``, we can estimate the region where the value of ``R-factor`` becomes small.
In this case, the following command will create a plot on a two-dimensional plot of the parameter space in ``ColorMapFig.png``.

.. code-block::

   $ python3 plot_colormap_2d.py -o ColorMapFig.png

Looking at the generated figure, we can see that it has the minimum value around (:math:`\pm 1.2`, :math:`\pm 0.8`).

.. figure:: ../../../common/img/plot_mapper.*

   Color map of R-factor with respect to x and y coordinates of S atom at z=-1.60.
